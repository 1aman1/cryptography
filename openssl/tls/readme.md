# TLS Handshake Process

The TLS handshake is used to establish a secure connection between a client and a server. It is commonly used in web browsers to secure HTTPS connections. The process consists of several steps:

1. **Client Hello**: The client initiates the connection by sending a "Client Hello" message to the server, including the supported TLS version, a list of supported ciphersuites, and a random value.

2. **Server Hello**: The server responds with a "Server Hello" message, selecting the TLS version, ciphersuite, and providing its own random value.

3. **Key Exchange**: The server sends its public key and, if required, a digital certificate to the client. The client verifies the server's certificate if provided and generates a pre-master secret.

4. **Client Key Exchange**: The client sends its own public key and, if necessary, a digital certificate. The server may verify the client's certificate.

5. **Finish Handshake**: Both client and server generate the session keys using the pre-master secret and exchanged values. They confirm that they are ready to start secure communication.

6. **Secure Communication**: With the session keys in place, the client and server can now encrypt and decrypt data for secure communication.


# Comparison

The main difference between the TLS handshake and mTLS is that mTLS adds mutual authentication, where both the client and server authenticate each other using digital certificates. In regular TLS, only the server is authenticated (the client is typically not). In mTLS, both parties are authenticated, which adds an extra layer of security and can be useful in situations where you need to be certain of the identities of both the client and server. However, mTLS can be more complex to set up and manage due to the need for client certificates.
